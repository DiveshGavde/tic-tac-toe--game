My very first react project.'Tic-tac-toe' game 
This app is build in small react components.where the App.jsx is the parent componet of all components which you will find in the 'src' folder,and the remaning components of this app which us the functionality to our app are in 'components' folder
It's a two player game which you can play with your friends.in which you also got a functionality to edit the player names.

I hope you will like it.
